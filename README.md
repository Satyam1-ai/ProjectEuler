# Project Euler Solutions 

Welcome! This repository contains my personal solutions to the challenging mathematical and computer programming problems found at [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/).

## 🎯 Goal
My current objective is to solve **500 problems**. I am documenting my progress and sharing my solutions as I work through them to improve my algorithmic thinking and mathematical problem-solving skills.

## 📊 Progress Tracker
- **Target:** 500 Problems
- **Last Updated:** January 2026

| Problem Range | Progress | Status |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| 1 – 100 | 0/100 | 🚧 In Progress |
| 101 – 200 | 0/100 | 🌑 Not Started |
| 201 – 300 | 0/100 | 🌑 Not Started |
| 301 – 400 | 0/100 | 🌑 Not Started |
| 401 – 500 | 0/100 | 🌑 Not Started |

## 📂 Project Structure
Each problem is organized into its own folder or file for clarity:
- `Problem_001/`: Multiples of 3 and 5
- `Problem_002/`: Even Fibonacci numbers
- ...and so on.
